# Problem Statement: Multi-Agent LLM-Based
Customer Service System for TeleCorp USA

## Background
TeleCorp USA, a leading telecommunications provider, maintains extensive
customer service and marketing data across multiple formats. The company
currently faces challenges in efficiently handling customer queries related to both
marketing information and technical error codes. These datasets are stored
separately - marketing data in CSV format and error codes with their explanations in
PDF documentation.

## Current Challenges
- Manual effort required to search across different data sources
- Inconsistent response times for customer queries
- Inefficient routing of queries to appropriate knowledge bases
- Limited scalability of current query handling system
- High dependency on human agents to interpret and combine information from
multiple sources

## Project Objective
Develop an intelligent multi-agent chatbot system leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) to automatically process, analyze, and respond to user queries by
accessing and interpreting data from multiple sources seamlessly.

### Core Requirements
1. Implementation of minimum two specialized agents:
- Marketing Data Agent: Responsible for processing queries related to marketing
information stored in CSV format
- Technical Support Agent: Handles queries related to error codes and their
explanations stored in PDF documentation

2. Intent Recognition System:
- Accurately identify query intent
- Route queries to the appropriate specialized agent
- Handle cases where queries might require information from multiple sources

3. Data Integration:
- Implement efficient data ingestion from CSV files (marketing data)
- Extract and structure information from PDF documentation (error codes)
- Maintain data integrity and accessibility for both agents

### Technical Specifications
1. Architecture:
- Multi-agent system design with clear interface definitions
- Integration with chosen LLM framework
- Scalable architecture to accommodate additional agents in future

2. Features:
- Natural language query processing
- Context-aware response generation
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Response quality assurance

3. Performance Requirements:
- Response time &lt; 10 seconds
- Accuracy rate &gt; 90% for intent recognition
- Proper handling of concurrent queries

## Deliverables

1. Functional multi-agent chatbot system
2. System architecture documentation
3. Implementation documentation
4. Testing results and performance metrics
5. User guide and maintenance documentation

## Evaluation Criteria
The system will be evaluated based on:
1. Accuracy of intent recognition
2. Quality and relevance of responses
3. Response time and system performance
4. Code quality and documentation
5. System scalability and maintainability
6. Error handling capabilities

## Constraints
1. Must use existing CSV and PDF data formats
2. System must be developed using industry-standard tools and frameworks
3. Must comply with data privacy and security requirements
4. Must be deployable in a cloud environment

## Success Metrics
1. Successful routing of queries to appropriate agents &gt; 95%
2. Accurate responses to the Query
3. Use of prompt engineering effectively
4. UI will have added advantage
You are expected to follow software engineering best practices, maintain proper
documentation, and provide regular progress updates throughout the development
cycle.
